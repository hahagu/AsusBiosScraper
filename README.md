# AsusBiosScraper
This program aims to find Asus bios that may not be listed publicly,
by trying to brute force scaning a URL range from Asus's bios database.
It does not download, nor flash any bios, just finds links to potential bios download links.

I, the creator, does not take any responsibility for any damages or legal issues caused by using this tool,
or flashing the bios that this tool provides links to.
